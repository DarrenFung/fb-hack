## Installation

* Don't worry about it.
* If you want to worry about it,
* Don't worry about it.
* But if you really do care,
* run *grunt build* if you want to build

## How to code

* Work from the extension/app/scripts directory - contentscript.js is where you can play with the DOM

## Test

* Open extensions in chrome, click on 'Load unpacked extension' and then select the 'extension/app' directory 
* If your changes don't reflect in the DOM, reload the extensions page and then reload the page you were trying to mess with
* Try this extension out for reloading all extensions: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extensions-reloader/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid
